    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // (100, 100)

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team); // ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'], ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']

    // team[3] = 'Lux';
    // console.log(players, team); // ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux'], ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux']
    // oh no! changing team also changes players since team is referencing players and not making a copy of it

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = splayers.slice();

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
      name: 'Tom',
      age: 28
    };
    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.age = 99;
    // this will change the person variable being referenced

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age:99})
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const tom = {
      name: 'Tom',
      age: 100,
      social{
        twitter:'@daileytj'
      }
    }

    //copy tom object
    const dev = Object.assign({}, tom);

    //if we try to change twitter, it will affect the original object since object.assign only works one level deep
